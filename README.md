<summary>Lab 7: RTL design using Verilog with SKY130 Technology </summary>
  
## Lab 7
1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis

![0 Screenshot from 2024-10-21 16-18-21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/096a7ff9-d3ef-4fed-9622-7244788a47e4)

In above figure, the central block is design, which consists of verilog code written as per specification for desired functionality.

To test whether the desired fuctionality is achieved, we need testbench which contains verilog code to generate set of stimulus and for given stimulus corresponding code for observer. Testbench also contains timing information related to running of simulation.

To perform above tasks, we use iverilog compiler and gtkwave waveform viewer as shown in following figure
![1 Screenshot from 2024-10-21 16-18-47](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6da79ef2-ee32-4cb6-b229-3e5516dabfae)

Following example shows a simple design of mux and corresponding testbench.
To run the verilog code in iverilog, and view waveforms in gtkwave, run the following three commands sequentially,
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bda941fb-c0c7-43ed-81b9-ee77f735da20)

Mux module
```
module good_mux (input i0 , input i1 , input sel , output reg y);
always @ (*)
begin
	if(sel)
		y <= i1;
	else 
		y <= i0;
end
endmodule
```
Testbench for mux module
```
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module tb_good_mux;
// Inputs
reg i0,i1,sel;
// Outputs
wire y;
// Instantiate the Unit Under Test (UUT), name based instantiation
	good_mux uut (.sel(sel),.i0(i0),.i1(i1),.y(y));
	//good_mux uut (sel,i0,i1,y);  //order based instantiation
initial begin
	$dumpfile("tb_good_mux.vcd");
	$dumpvars(0,tb_good_mux);
	// Initialize Inputs
	sel = 0;
	i0 = 0;
	i1 = 0;
	#300 $finish;
end
always #75 sel = ~sel;
always #10 i0 = ~i0;
always #55 i1 = ~i1;
endmodule
```
## Yosys and Logic synthesis

Yosys is a logic/RTL synthesis software suite which converts verilog, represented by Design block into netlist as shown in following diagram.

The block shown as .lib contains standard library cells which are present in pdk.

To perform synthesis, yosys needs commands as read_verilog, read_verilog, write_verilog.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c0ea0b6-4835-4fb0-a8fd-c838036a9eed)

Once netlist is generated, it needs to be verified, for that it is run through iverilog, output vcd file is generated, which is run through gtkwave.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91c62c0e-883b-4425-97e4-eb01ff193e46)

Following command loads the liberty file containing standard cells, as shown, 418 cells types are imported,
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00e054c8-5378-4c0a-878c-ce58171e8a5b)

Next, using read_verilog, we generated RTL for given design,
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecc37670-2191-42eb-b4a1-87842a62bcf1)

Following command is used for synthesis of top module
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23e97d6d-b672-484d-9112-7e9d7189faa8)

Following command generates the netlist,

Next write netlist which can be used for simulation,
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61bb5247-3b37-4d8f-b155-e428b1e471b9)

The generated netlist is as follows
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6b86354-2694-4d00-9b88-bbe2ed12bfe1)


2 - (a) Timing libs, (b) hierarchical vs flat synthesis and (c) efficient flop coding styles

liberty file contains information about standard cells such as, timing, power, area parameters. Also, multiple forms of same logic cell are available in standard cell library with different characteristics.

Whenever there are multiple modules are present in design, the netlist can be synthesised in either hierarchical form or as flat form.

4 - Gate level synthesis, blocking vs non-blocking statements and Synthesis-Simulation mismatch

Previously, RTL synthesis is carried out where netlist is generated from verilog code, which uses standard cells of pdk.
Observe that synthesised netlist and RTL verilog code are logically same. This netlist will contain for example and gate with input and output.
In gate level synthesis, abstract gates in synthesised netlist are replaced with gate level verilog models which can be functional models or timing aware models.

Once netlist generated after gate level synthesis, we need to do functional verification to remove synthesis-simulation mismatch. 
Some of the reasons for synthesis-simulation mismatch are, missing sensity list, block-non blocking assignments or non standard verilog code.

<summary>Lab 9: Static Timing Analysis of design using OpenSTA </summary>

Static Timing analysis involves checking of design in terms of whether timing requirements are met for each path within the design.
The input to static timing analysis tool is the synthesised netlist generated, clock definations and other constraints related to input and output, it is independent of logic inputs.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78a7b014-56c6-4971-9dd0-43fdef8eeb64)

source: https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/static-timing-analysis-sta/

STA tool breaks down the whole design into different path and check whether the delay present in signal propogation is not creating issue in correct functioning of the design.

Two of the most common timing constraints in design are setup time and hold time constraints. When static timing analysis is performed, STA tool reports whether these timing constraints are met for everypath in design.

In this lab, OpenSTA is used to perform static timing analysis. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baac721a-fb9b-4398-975f-ef2b37ec303a)

### Lab Task 
1) Clock period of 10.15ns. 
2) Setup uncertainty and clock transition will be 5% of clock - use set_clock_uncertainty with 10.15 * 0.05
3) Hold uncertainty and data transition will be 8% of clock - use set_clock_uncertainty with 10.15 * 0.08

1) Input to OpenSTA includes synthesised netlist, liberty file containg pdk and other clock related and path related definations.

### Summary of simplified RTL to GDSII flow based on OpenLANE,

1. Synthesis - Design RTL is converted to circuits with componets form Standard cell library(SCL)

2. Floor/Power planning -

   a. Chip floor planning - partition the chip die between different system building blocks and place IO pads

   b. Macro Floor planning -  Dimensions, pin locations, rows definition

   c. Powerplanning - Power network is created which includes, Power pads, Power straps, Power rings

3. Placement - Place the cells on the floorplan rows

4. Clock Tree Synthesis - Create a clock distribution network to deliver the clock to all sequential elements

5. Routing - Connecting cells together using available metal layers

6. Sign Off - Includes Physical verification through Design Rules Checking(DRC) and Layout vs Schematic(LVS) and Timing verification through Static Timing Analysis(STA).

![workingdir](images/synth.png)
#### d. Steps to characterise Synthesis results

![workingdir](images/numberofcells.png)
![workingdir](images/dffnum.png)
Flop ratio calculations require, total number of cells synthesised and the number of flipflops among that,

```math
Flop\ ratio = \frac{number\ of\ flipflops}{total\ number\ of\ cells} = \frac{1613}{14876} = 0.10842968539

```
```math
Percentage\ of\ D-flipflops = 0.10842968539 * 100 = 10.842968539\ \%
```
