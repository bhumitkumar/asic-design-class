<summary>Lab 1: Compiling a small C program with gcc compiler and RISCV gcc compiler </summary>

## Lab 1A: Compiling a C program with gcc compiler, execute it and generate the output.

Write the C code in a file using any text editor and save it as sum1ton.c (source code).

Next, compile the source code using gcc compiler, this will generate the executable code.

Now, run the executable code to see the output.

Following image includes the source code and three commands to execute in terminal in sequence as shown, to generate the output.

## Lab 1B: Compiling a C program with RISCV gcc compiler, execute it, generate the output and compare with the output of Lab 1B.

The next task is to compile the sum1ton.c using RISCV gcc compiler using the command in following image, also to see the assembly code for C program, use the next command.

Observe that object code dump generates the following, main function is present at location 10184 and 15 instructions are present in assembly code.

Next, try 0fast of RISCV compiler for same C code and observe the object code dump, now the main function is located at 100b0 and number of instructions present is 12.

  <summary>Lab 5: TL Verilog to Verilog conversion using Sandpiper and testing the converted Verilog based riscvcore </summary>

  ## Lab 5

In Lab 4, in makerchip, riscvcore is built using TL Verilog, it generates tlv file. The tlv file generated in Lab4 is given to Sandpiper converter to generate verilog code.
In Lab 5, task is to match the output waveforms generated on makerchip and those generated by gtkwave after running testbench.

Following image shows the verilog generated by Sandpiper being compiled by iverilog and output waveform can be seen in next image on gtkwave.

Clock name is clk_bhu(makechip) and clk_bhu1(gtkwave) and sum can be seen in out which matches the output of makerchip in lab 4 which was generated by TL Verilog riscvcore.

  <summary>Lab 6: Simulating Riscv-core with PLL and DAC, Yosys installation. </summary>

  ## Lab 6

  In Lab 5, riscv core was compiled in iverilog and program to sum 1 to 9 was shown working with output seen in gtkwave.
  In lab 6, with riscv core, DAC and PLL are added and the output of sum of numbers can be seen with its analog equivalent.
